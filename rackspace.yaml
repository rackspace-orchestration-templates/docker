abstract: |
  Linux server with [Docker](http://docker.io/) installed.

  This deployment is intended for simple test cases and low traffic
  scenarios. It is not for high traffic events and is not easily scalable.

  #### Getting Started
  If you're new to Docker, check out [Getting started with
  Docker](https://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/). The getting started document
  will help guide you through the initial steps of managing containers.

  #### Docker Deployment Notes
  If a container was defined to be installed, this deployment will attempt to
  install it from the [Docker index](https://index.docker.io/) or the registry
  you specified.

  If a container port was specified, but no host port, Docker will map the
  container port to a random port on your public interfaces. To see determine
  the mapping, find the ID of your container and then use the inspect command
  to find the PortBindings. By using 'ps' and 'inspect', here is how we would
  find a mapping:

  ```bash
  root@docker:~# docker ps -a
  CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
  e33daf024abc        ubuntu:12.04        sleep 60            16 minutes ago      Exit 0                                  ubuntu

  #### Additional Modules
  There are hundreds of images that have been created by an engaged developer
  community. You can browse the images on the Docker
  [registry](https://index.docker.io).

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided in the passwords section can be used to login as
  root via SSH.  We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).
